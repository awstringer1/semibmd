# Install the `semibmd` package

The package is hosted at (https://github.com/awstringer1/semibmd)[https://github.com/awstringer1/semibmd]. It's currently a private repo so you can't install using e.g. `remotes::install_github`. Instead, clone the repository to a local directory, say
`~/work/projects/benchmark-dose/code/semibmd` for example,
and then in `R` do:
```{r install_it,message=FALSE}
install.packages(pkgs='~/work/projects/benchmark-dose/code/semibmd',repos=NULL,type='source')
library(semibmd)
```
